==Description== 
Jackson Gators is a swim team located in Jackson, TN. This website was made to inform residents of Jackson TN about the team and give them contact information. 
  
 ==Pages== 
  
  =Home= 
 The home page gives an overall description of the Jackson Gatos Swim Team. This page is unique to all the other pages because it includes a Java Script slide show. We thought the slide-show was a nice touch to give the site a fun feeling. 
  
  
  =Contact= 
 The contact page obviously gives the viewer contact information. We added animated contact links for phone, email, and even Facebook. This provides easy access to numerous different types of contact in a cool way. 
  
  
  =Location= 
 The location page contains a useful, interactive Google map showing where the swim team is located (University of Memphis Lambuth). On this page, we perfected the responsiveness so the map can be used on any device with ease. We also added a small description under the map. 
  
  
  =Join= 
 The join page features a PHP form. It provides a way for people viewing the website to give the Jackson Gators their contact info and ask them questions. We kept a clean design on this page to look as professional as possible. The form itself will give messages for both a successful submission and a failed submission. 
  
  =Goal= 
 The goal page was first made to show a simple description of the swim teams goal. We made sure to keep the same font and style as all the other pages. Then, we added a nice textbox and 2 internal sites to suit the user's needs. 
  
  
  =Coaches= 
 The coaches page has unique self-made graphics that give information about the coaches. We reversed the gradient that we used on the webpage background to make these pop. The pictures were formatted to look clean in the center of the graphic. The Instagram logo provides quick access to the coach's social media.  
  
  
  =Times= 
 The times page contains many useful items. First, we added a PDF document to give the viewer as much information as possible. This document contains certified time standards that we attained from seswim.org. Under that, we put a link to the same document just in case it didn't work on the viewers device. Lastly, we inserted a link that sends the viewer to usaswimming.org. We formatted the sentence to expand when a pointer is hovering over the link. 
  
  
 =Pictures= 
The pictures page provides a way for the viewer to see what the swim team is about in a visual way. We added a time lapse of one of the team's practices. Under that, we inserted numerous photos with black borders so they would pop. The page as a whole looks appealing.  
 
==Other== 
 
  =Header= 
Our header was made to look sleek and be responsive. The links have hover animation and change colors when selected. Our logo has an invisible background and is also a link to the home page. We added a line to make things look organized. 
 
  =Footer= 
We chose to make a simple sticky footer that isn't too flashy. It provides navigation to other pages and some basic contact information.
